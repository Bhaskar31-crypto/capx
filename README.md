Stock Movement Prediction Based on Social Media
Sentiment
Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stock movements using social media
sentiment analysis. Data is scraped from user-generated content on platforms such as Twitter, Reddit,
or Telegram, and analyzed to extract insights related to stock price trends.
Features
1. Data Scraping
- Scrapes relevant stock discussions and predictions from chosen platforms.
- Cleans and preprocesses the scraped data for use in the model.
2. Sentiment Analysis
- Performs sentiment analysis or topic modeling on the data to identify sentiment polarity and other
stock indicators.
3. Prediction Model
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict stock price trends.
- Evaluates model accuracy with historical data and provides performance metrics.
  Technical Requirements
Programming Language
- Java (Primary)
Libraries & Frameworks
- Web Scraping: JSoup (for scraping HTML content from websites).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Stanford NLP or DL4J (DeepLearning4J) for text processing.
- Machine Learning: Weka or DL4J for building and evaluating models.
Tools
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- Build Tool: Maven or Gradle.
- Database: MySQL or SQLite for storing scraped and processed data.
Installation
Prerequisites
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 11 or later.
2. Maven/Gradle - Dependency management.
3. MySQL - Database setup.
4. Social Media API keys (if applicable):
- Twitter API (via Twitter Developer Account).
- Reddit API (via Reddit Apps).
- Telegram API (via Telegram Bot).
Steps
1. Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/username/stock-sentiment-predictor.git
cd stock-sentiment-predictor
2. Install required dependencies using Maven/Gradle.
mvn install
3. Configure your API keys and database settings in the `config.properties` file.
4. Build the project.
mvn clean compile package

Usage
Running the Application
1. Start the application:
java -jar target/stock-sentiment-predictor.jar
2. The application will scrape data, preprocess it, and output prediction results in the console/log files.
Customizing Parameters
- Modify the `config.properties` file to adjust API keys, database credentials, or scraping intervals.
- Evaluation
1. Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
2. Improvements:
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Incorporating additional social media platforms.
- Advanced NLP techniques for better sentiment analysis.
